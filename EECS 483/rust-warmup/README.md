# Rust Warmup

Complete this assignment by completing the EXERCISES in `src/lib.rs` and `src/arith.rs`.

Submit this to gradescope either by submitting a zip file containing
(at least) the following files:

1. `Cargo.toml`
2. `src/lib.rs`
3. `src/arith.rs`

If you get a compilation error, make sure that your zip file contains
the files themselves, not the directory containing them. That is,
running `unzip submission.zip` in an empty directory `tmp` should
result in `Cargo.toml` and `src` being directly inside `tmp`.
